# DreamerV3

🚫🚧👷‍♀️ Warning: Under Construction 👷‍♂️🚧🚫

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the DreamerV3 algorithm, aimed at providing a more readable and understandable version compared to the official implementations. It serves as an opportunity to learn and explore the intricacies of the DreamerV3 algorithm while maintaining clarity and simplicity.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Create a new conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -n dreamerv3 python=3.11
    conda activate dreamerv3
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Acknowledgements

This implementation draws inspiration from the following repositories:

- [Official DreamerV3 JAX Implementation](https://github.com/danijar/dreamerv3)
- [DreamerV3 PyTorch Implementation by NM512](https://github.com/NM512/dreamerv3-torch)

These resources have been invaluable in understanding the DreamerV3 algorithm and creating this more accessible implementation.
